# â¬œ BETN NETWORK

**Introducing BetN: Revolutionizing Decentralized Betting**

BetN stands as a pioneering force in decentralized betting, leveraging blockchain technology to introduce the world's first fully decentralized betting exchange. Built on solidity contracts, BetN ensures complete decentralization, offering users a seamless and transparent betting experience.

**Automated Bet Maker (ABM) vs. Traditional Exchanges**

In contrast to traditional exchanges, BetN operates on a fundamentally different premise. While centralized exchanges require users to place bets at specific odds and await backing from others, BetN simplifies this process by automatically backing all bets at fluid odds as they are placed. This radical approach streamlines decentralization, making betting more accessible and efficient for users.

**Understanding Pools in Markets**

At the heart of BetN lies the concept of pools within markets. Every possible outcome in a market represents a pool of contributions from users. For example, in the  **Full Time Game Result** market, pools are created for outcomes such as **HOME**, **AWAY**, and **DRAW**. When users place bets on a particular outcome, they are essentially betting against contributions made to other pools.

**Earning Your Winnings**

After placing a bet, users eagerly await the outcome of the game. In the event of a win, users receive their bet amount refunded in full, along with a share of the winnings from the losing pools. For instance, if a user contributed 10% of all funds in the HOME pool and the HOME team emerges victorious, they are entitled to 10% of the bounty from the losing pools.
