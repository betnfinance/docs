# üï∑Ô∏è How to make money?

## **Make Money** Without betting.

If you're looking to participate in the Betn ecosystem without traditional betting, there are several avenues you can explore:

1. **Community Ownership**: Own a Community NFT to claim 5% of all bets placed in eligible games. Community NFT holders enjoy lifetime commissions. To become a Community NFT owner you  can either mint a new NFT or purchase one from the market.
2. **Team Ownership**: Own a Team NFT and claim 5% commissions on all bets placed on your team, provided it emerges victorious. Team Ownership offers a lifetime commission structure and can be obtained through the Team NFT mint contract.
3. **Joint Ownership Scheme**: Participate in the Joint Ownership Scheme to earn fees from unpurchased NFTs. Betn mints NFTs and adds them to the scheme, allowing users to make a non-refundable payment and start earning a fraction of fees allocated to Community NFT owners.
4. **Validator Role**: Validators play a crucial role in submitting game results and are rewarded with up to 50 Betn per game result submitted. Users can also delegate or rent the validator role to others, offering flexibility and potential rewards.
5. **Becoming a Bookie**: As a Betn bookie, you can claim 5% of all winnings across the games you manage. Focus on promoting your games effectively to attract players, without the need to back bets yourself.

These opportunities provide diverse ways to engage with Betn's ecosystem, offering avenues for earning rewards and contributing to the platform's success. For more information and to get started, explore the provided links to relevant mint contracts and additional resources.

## **Make Money via Betting on Betn**

1. **Hold BETN Tokens**: Holding BETN tokens allows users to participate as a collective bookmaker on the Liquidity Bookie. While no rewards are directly minted, any lost BETN tokens are burned, reducing circulation. Additionally, any native tokens collected are added as liquidity. This mechanism provides an opportunity for significant gains if betting results favor the bookies.
2. **Bet Against the Liquidity Bookie**: Users can add multiple bets on a single slip on the LP Bookie contract, thereby increasing their odds and potential payout. This strategy enables users to hedge their bets effectively and optimize their chances of winning.
3. **Bet on the Decentralized Exchange**: Join a pool in any market and claim winnings in native tokens, USDT, or BETN. By participating in decentralized exchanges, users can leverage their predictive skills to earn rewards based on market outcomes.

These methods offer various ways to generate income through betting on Betn. Whether through holding tokens, betting against the Liquidity Bookie, or participating in decentralized exchanges, users can explore diverse avenues for profit within the Betn ecosystem.
