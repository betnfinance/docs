The primary objective of this initial stage is to establish a functional proof of concept for BetN. Our focus during this phase will be on soccer games, with a clear roadmap to expand to other sports in subsequent phases. We aim to achieve the following key milestones:

1. **Development of BetN Contracts:** We will develop robust smart contracts for BetN using Solidity programming language, tailored to target Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains. These contracts will include the creation of an ERC20 token, essential for powering the network and facilitating transactions within the platform.
2. **Creation of BetN Network Documentation, White Paper, and Social Media Presence:** Comprehensive documentation, including a white paper, will be crafted to outline the vision, technology, and roadmap of BetN. Additionally, we will establish official social media accounts to engage with our community, share updates, and foster transparency.
3. **Development of BetN Dapp User Interface:** Our team will design and develop an intuitive user interface (UI) for the BetN decentralized application (Dapp). This will involve creating a seamless betting UI, implementing efficient sports data management and display features, and facilitating user registration to onboard participants onto the platform.
4. **Deployment of BetN Contracts:** We will deploy the developed BetN contracts to both the Goerli Testnet and the Binance Mainnet for testing and production purposes. This step ensures that our smart contracts operate as intended in a real-world environment, providing security and reliability to our users.
5. **Domain Registration and Server Setup:** Securing the domains betn.io and betn.finance, we will establish the online presence necessary for our platform. Additionally, setting up servers will ensure the smooth operation of the user interface, providing a stable and responsive experience for our users.

3. **SEO Optimization for Key Keywords:** Implementing SEO strategies to optimize visibility for key keywords related to BetN, such as "BetN," "betn.io," "decentralized sports betting," and "blockchain sports betting." Enhanced search engine visibility will drive organic traffic to our platform, expanding our reach and user base.
4. **Building Telegram Community:** Our goal is to establish a vibrant community on Telegram, with a target of reaching 4,000 users on our group ([https://t.me/betnfinance](https://t.me/betnfinance)). Through engaging discussions, updates, and exclusive content, we aim to foster a strong sense of community among BetN enthusiasts.
5. **Growing Twitter Following:** We will actively grow our presence on Twitter, aiming to reach 3,000 followers on our official account ([https://x.com/betnfinance](https://x.com/betnfinance)). Regular updates, engaging content, and interaction with followers will be key strategies to expand our reach and brand awareness.
6. **User Registrations on BetN Website:** Encouraging user registrations on our platform, [www.betn.io](http://www.betn.io/), with a target of 1,000 registered users. Providing a seamless registration process and highlighting the benefits of joining BetN will incentivize users to sign up and participate in our decentralized sports betting ecosystem.

Through diligent pursuit of these milestones, BetN is poised to establish itself as a leading player in the burgeoning landscape of blockchain-based sports betting, fostering a vibrant community and delivering unparalleled user experiences.



## Partial Decentralized Launch.

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">JUNE 2024 - SEPTEMBER 2024</mark>

The BetN Network is designed to ultimately achieve full decentralization through community governance, wherein all proposed improvements and changes undergo community proposals and subsequent voting. However, during the initial launch phase, the governance system will be temporarily disabled, granting the BetN team full control over updates and changes. This measure is implemented to facilitate the effective deployment of contracts across multiple chains. All administrative privileges will be seamlessly transferred to the governor alpha contract by October 1st, 2024.

Key Milestones:

1. **Expansion of BetN to Support Additional Sports:** BetN will be expanded to encompass a wider array of sports, including NFL, NBA, basketball, baseball, handball, volleyball, and hockey. This expansion aims to diversify the platform's offerings and cater to a broader audience of sports enthusiasts.
2. **Deployment of BetN Contracts on Multiple Blockchains:** The BetN contracts will be deployed on various blockchain networks, including Base Mainnet, Arbitrum One Mainnet, Avalanche C Chain Mainnet, and Polygon Mainnet. This multi-chain deployment enhances accessibility and interoperability, allowing users to seamlessly transact across different networks.
3. **Expansion of Validators on Each Blockchain Network:** The BetN network will grow its validator base on each blockchain network to a minimum of 100 validators. These validators play a crucial role in securing the network and validating game results, ensuring core integrity and reliability.
4. **Increase in Liquidity of BetN Tokens:** BetN aims to enhance liquidity by growing the liquidity pool to $5,000,000 on each blockchain network where it operates. Increased liquidity contributes to a more vibrant and efficient marketplace, facilitating smoother trading and price discovery for BetN tokens.
5. **Expansion of BetN Holder Base:** The number of BetN token holders will be increased to a minimum of 100,000 addresses on each blockchain network. This broadens the platform's user base and decentralizes ownership, promoting community participation and governance.

By achieving these milestones, BetN is positioned to solidify its presence as a leading decentralized sports betting platform, offering a diverse range of sports options and fostering a robust and inclusive ecosystem across multiple blockchain networks.



## Governance, Audit and open source

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">OCTOBER 2024 - DECEMBER 2024</mark>

During this pivotal phase, the BetN community will assume full control over on-chain activities within the network, marking a significant milestone towards decentralization and community-driven governance.

Key Milestones:

1. **Transfer of Administrative Privileges to the Governor Alpha Contract:** All administrative privileges within the BetN contracts will be seamlessly transferred to the Governor Alpha contract. This shift ensures that governance decisions are made collectively by the community, fostering transparency and decentralization.
2. **Contract Audits by Certik:** To uphold the highest standards of security and reliability, BetN contracts will undergo rigorous audits by Certik, a leading blockchain security firm. These audits will identify and address any potential vulnerabilities, enhancing the overall integrity of the BetN network.
3. **Open Source GitHub Repository for Contracts and User Interface:** BetN will establish an open-source GitHub repository, providing transparency and accessibility to its smart contracts and user interface codebase. This initiative encourages collaboration, peer review, and community contributions, driving innovation and trust within the ecosystem.
4. **Canvassing for Votes Delegation to the BetN Team:** The BetN team will engage in canvassing efforts to encourage votes delegation to empower the team to propose and enact governance decisions on behalf of the community. This collaborative approach ensures efficient governance while maintaining community involvement and oversight.
5. **Commencement of BetN V2 Development on GitHub:** BetN V2 development will commence on GitHub, focusing on further improving the network's functionality, scalability, and user experience. Community feedback and contributions will be integral to shaping the direction of BetN V2, ensuring alignment with user needs and preferences.

Through these milestones, BetN is poised to transition into a fully decentralized and community-governed platform, fostering a culture of transparency, inclusivity, and innovation. This phase marks a significant step forward in BetN's journey towards empowering its users and realizing the vision of a truly decentralized sports betting ecosystem.
