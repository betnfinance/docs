# ðŸ“– BETN ACCUMULATOR

The Betn Accumulator bookie introduces an odds aggregation feature that allows users to to place multiple bets in a single slip to win BETN tokens as payout. This ACCA contract allows members to combine multiple betting odds on a single stake in order to get a bigger payday. All bets on the slip must win in order to get payout.

Key Features:

1. **Native (BNB/ETH) or BETN Token Betting:** Users have the flexibility to place bets using either Native Token or BETN tokens. However, regardless of the currency used for betting, all payouts are exclusively made in freshly minted BETN tokens.
2. &#x20;**Accumulator Bets and Random Odds:** Bet winnings are determined by randomly generated odds for each game with the possibility to place multiple bets on one betting slip, in order to increase final payout size.
3. **Token Burning and Liquidity Addition:** When users purchase betting slips with BETN tokens, the collected tokens are burned, reducing the token supply and contributing to deflation. Conversely, when users use Native Tokens for betting, these tokens are added as liquidity to the pool, enhancing liquidity within the ecosystem.
4. **Network Dynamics:** The Accumulator bookie operates in a dynamic manner, influencing the overall network size through its interactions with users. If the Accumulator Bookie wins, i.e., the burned tokens exceed the minted tokens, the network shrinks and deflates. Conversely, if the bookie loses, the network expands and inflates. **Importantly,** the Bookie contract operates fairly, with no bias towards itself, ensuring a level playing field for all participants.
